# .NET architecture in Typescript

Backend application, built on the principle .NET applications, written in **Typescript & Knex & Typedi & Routing controllers**.<br />

The project is being developed **for fun**.
You can use it easiely for your startups, but in my opinion there are newer technologies like **typeorm** and **Nest.js**

## Usage

```
  git clone https://github.com/justmavi/knex-app.git

  npm run migrations
  npm start
```
